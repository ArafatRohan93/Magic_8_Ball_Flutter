# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

## Goal

The objective of this challenge is to solidify what I've learn't in the Dicee tutorial. This app guided me through the steps required to build an 8 ball app and I have applyed what I have learnt about Stateless and Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What is created

I made a magical 8 ball app, it will give you the answers to all the tricky questions in life. You can make the ball change at the press of a button.
